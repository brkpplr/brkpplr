### Hi there 👋, I'm Bruno Köppel (Rodríguez) 🙇

- After being born in Cuba, I wrote my first program at the age of 14. It was after school in a dark lab built in the corner of my school. Using the Dev-C++ Code Editor in a Ubuntu 10 LTS distro, I wrote the first lines that every programmer gets to write. "Hello Word" appeared on a black screen where a blinking cursor waited for input.

- By profession I do programming, but my interests go beyond code. Composing Electronic Music, calculating transformations of 3D objects, simulating any sort of abstract scenario, these are the beauties of what computers allow and what I enjoy doing after a long day at work. At [BrunoKoppel.com](http://brunokoppel.com) is where I document some of these things, always looking for cool things to build and explore.

### Programming 💻 Experience

- 3 years of C/C++
