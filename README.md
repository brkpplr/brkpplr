### Hi there 👋, Name is Bruno Köppel (Rodríguez)

- ⚡ Fun Fact: I wrote my first program when I was 14 years old. It was afterschool, in the computer lab of my middle school back in Cuba, when I wrote my first hello world program in C, using the Dev-C++ IDE. Another fun fact is that they were running ubuntu distros in there instead of the usual windows os that other labs had.

- 🔭 I am a Programmer, sometimes a tinkerer. Currently working on a whole lot of projects which you can see in more detail at my [website](http://brunokoppel.com), always looking for cool things to build and explore.

- 🎛 I make electronic music -> [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6BdSmIpqVam6MashlNUOoK?si=f8mVigR-TQaATPULzTWL-w) 

- 👯 Need a application tester, a C/C++ specialist, maybe just a buddy for your open source? Well, I'm open to help and collaborate!

- 📫 You can reach me out at my email in this github page, at twitter, LinkedIn.

#### Experience
- 3 years of C
- 2 year of C++
- 1 years of Web Development with js and ts (React, Gatsby, GraphQl, Express, Nx)
- 1 years of Python
